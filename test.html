    <h1>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</h1>
    <p>He is here. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
    <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I call it luck. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! <strong> How am I supposed to fight?</strong> <em> Oh God, my uncle.</em> How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
    <h2>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</h2>
    <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li><li>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

    <h3>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</h3>
    <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</li><li>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</li><li>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Red Five standing by. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…</p>
    <p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
    <p>What?! Ye-ha! Ye-ha! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
    <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
    <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
    <p>He is here. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
    <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I'm trying not to, kid.</p>
    <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? You mean it controls your actions? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p>
    <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
    <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. What?! Ye-ha! I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
    <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Don't underestimate the Force.</p>
